    "Total sort with ordered partitions has been implemented in questions 5.4.1 B and C. Total sort should not be required for parts A and D of 5.4.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total sort with ordered partitions has been implemented in Step 1 of question 5.5 that identifies the 9,000th - 10,000th most common words. This total sort works, but has not been carefully checked for accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total sort with ordered partitions has also been implemented in Step 3 of question 5.5 that calculates similarity scores from the stripes built in Step 2. This has been implemented so that the output is sorted and we can easily get the top 1,000 synonyms for evaluation in step 5.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the systems tests on the very small datasets to build stripes, build inverted indices, and calculate similarity scores in 5.4.0 have been tested on altiscale and run smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.4.1.A has been run on altiscale and runs smoothly, albeit slowly.\n",
    "    - Report stats for this job have been updated after running on altiscale cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.4.1.B has been run on altiscale and runs smoothly. Partitions need to be adjusted.\n",
    "    - Report stats for this job have been updated after running on altiscale cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.4.1.C has been run on altiscale and runs smoothly on one subset of the google 5-gram dataset. Partitions need to be adjusted.\n",
    "    - There is an error that occurrs and is noted in the code cells below when this step is run on the full 5-gram data.\n",
    "    - Report stats for this job have been updated after running on altiscale cluster, but the job needs to be run again after partitions are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action Items.\n",
    "1. Figure out how to more dynamically create the partition files based on the distributions of word counts observed in the data.\n",
    "    - Search this document for #Action item 1 for places where this needs to be implemented.\n",
    "2. In question 5.5, output of step 1 currently being written to HDFS per Kyle Hamilton's suggestion. Thus, the list of 9,000th - 10,000th most common words must be pulled from HDFS to a local file that can be read in to the map stage of Step 2 of our implementation of question 5.5.\n",
    "    - Search this document for #Action item 2 for the place where this needs to be implemented.\n",
    "    - See, for example 5.4.1.B to see an example of how to feed an HDFS directory to an mrjob. It seems that you can feed an HDFS directory as an input and the job will automatically read in all of the files within that HDFS directory.\n",
    "3. In question 5.5, the output of step 2 that builds stripes will output to HDFS. Need to figure out how to read the stripes from HDFS into step 3 that calculates similarities.\n",
    "    - Search this document for Action item 3 for the place where this needs to be implemented."
