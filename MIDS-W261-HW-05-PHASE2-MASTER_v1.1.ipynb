    "Total sort with ordered partitions has been implemented in Step 1 of question 5.5 that identifies the 9,000th - 10,000th most common words. This total sort works, but has not been carefully checked for accuracy.\n",

    "Total sort with ordered partitions has also been implemented in Step 3 of question 5.5 that calculates similarity scores from the stripes built in Step 2. This has been implemented so that the output is sorted and we can easily get the top 1,000 synonyms for evaluation in step 5.6.\n",
